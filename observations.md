In the app I built two circuits- both the same except for voltage source. The voltage sources were 2 volts and 4 volts. Each circuit had one red LED, one 100 OHM resistor, and a ground wire. 

It seems like the main takeaway of voltage and current is that even though they are directly related to one another, current cannot be created without the voltage. Voltage provides the power for the current to flow through, the more volts, the faster the current, the more resistance, the slower.
